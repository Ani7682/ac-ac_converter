# ac-ac_converter
In this project, a AC-AC Converter is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform and RMS values.

AC to AC converters is used for converting the AC waveforms with one particular frequency and magnitude to AC waveform with another frequency at another magnitude. This conversion is mainly required in case of speed controlling of machines, for low frequency and variable voltage magnitude applications as well. We know that there are different types of loads that work with different types of power supplies like single-phase, and three-phase supply, and the supplies can be differentiated based on the voltage and frequency range also.
